# DareDev README
Challenges for DareDev May 28th, 2015

# Installation
Need a working node+npm environment. Use homebrew (OS X only) to install node.

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```

# Rules
NO browser previews. Anything else is fair game. Use syntax checkers and linters to avoid simple mistakes.
Javascript is not permitted (it wouldn't help you very much anyway).

# Format
Each challenge directory (prefixed with the word 'challenge') is where you will find the base template
for that round. For simplicity you can include all HTML and CSS into this file.

# Judging
Each index.html file will be loaded by an up-to-date Chrome web browser. Your submission will only
be judged on the final rendered output of the index.html file. Your submission will not be judged on
code quality or any other HTML/CSS 'best practices'. The only factor is how the final rendered
index.html looks compared to the referrence design.
